NEW ROLES:
Being a college student and a scholar in DLS-CSB, my new classmates think of me as a smart and hardworking student. To fulfil their expectations, I tried my best to be smart in all subjects, even if I知 not in to some subjects, and to be reliable, even if I知 lazy sometimes. I started my college life at this state, and I want to stay like this because I know that it can change me a lot.
NEW ROUTINES:
In my years in high school, transportation consists of a ride in a jeep and another in a tricycle. Now, I also need to ride two LRT trains in order to reach DLS-CSB. I also have to choose the place to eat where the foods are not expensive. I also need to budget my money because I値l go home with nothing if I didn稚.
NEW RELATIONSHIPS:
Starting on the first day, I already made new relationships with my block mates. Unlike in my high school life that I知 the silent type, I showed my wittiness with my new friends. I already gained relationships with all of us on the first week, unlike before that I almost took one month to know all of them.
NEW ASSUMPTIONS:
Some of my thoughts in high school about college are not the things I知 doing now. Now that I知 in college, I now make assumptions about my life in adulthood. Sounds matured, right? I also expect some things about my later terms. I hope it痴 not hard as I知 thinking it.
