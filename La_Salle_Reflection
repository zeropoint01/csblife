“An evil thought defiles the soul when it is deliberate and consented to. Our Lord placed evil thoughts at the head of all crimes, because they are their principle and source” – St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle
Even if St. La Salle became an educator, he didn’t forget what he really is: a priest. He thought the poor children despite of lack of funds and the energy they were spending with his brothers. It became an inspiration to other countries even if St. La Salle didn’t thought of that in the first place.
Going back to the quote, St. La Salle emphasized the evil works and thoughts. Since birth, we were learning thoughts in the environment, even the thought of what is right and wrong. That means that any thought our society taught us is true to our mind. We bring these thoughts as we grow old, but we were also learning new thoughts and some of them were replacing our old thoughts about life.
Only the ones who know that something is evil can determine that is evil, like St. La Salle. He emphasized that something evil, when taught to a person, corrupts its soul when desperate on something. It also applies to children because of their desperation of knowing things, or curiosity. These evil thoughts were the cause of crimes and sins, as St. La Salle said.
Let’s have an example. A man was dying because of hunger and said that he would do anything just to fill up his stomach. With this attitude, he can be easily manipulated by evil thoughts, like robbing or killing. St. La Salle thought us to be decisive in what we are accepting or answering in our everyday lives.
