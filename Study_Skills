1. 
 - I failed in some exams in my high school times, but not that too low. I just didn't reach the passing grade or the cutoff. It is maybe because of my confidence in answering and relying on my stock knowledge.

2. 
 - I just fail at some time, but I always pass exams, specifically the college entrance exams I took. I always get a perfect score whenever there will be a quiz/activity/test in Mathematics, and I also pass my other subjects, too.

3.
 - I felt more serious in my CSB midterms. It's just the same when I took my entrance examinations: carefully watched. When I was in high school, I just get confident in my tests and don't care if others would copy my answers. Now, I'm more secured and don't let them cheat, because it is a policy. And because of it, I'll do it again for the CSB Finals.
